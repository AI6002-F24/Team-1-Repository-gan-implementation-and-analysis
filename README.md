## Note
This implementation served as a crucial experiment in our project's development. The comprehensive metrics and analysis led to our strategic pivot toward CNN optimization, which proved significantly more effective for our specific use case. The documented challenges with GAN-based generation, particularly in preserving critical radar characteristics and resource efficiency, supported this decision. The extensive resource requirements and quality issues made it clear that focusing on CNN optimization would be more productive for our project goals.
